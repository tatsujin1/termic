TERMinal Interface (using) Cells

Inspiration was actually my own, but I later discovered https://github.com/gdamore/tcell and https://github.com/nsf/termbox.

This is a personal project, and undergoing lots of changes. It is most
assuredly not ready for any kind of "prime-time".  But feel free to
look around and try it.


## Dependencies

Some C++20 features might be used somewhere, but C++17 is definitely required.

* libfmt  (actually not, but currently used for debug logging)
* TheWhisp signals
